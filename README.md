    <p>Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people looking to rent out their homes with those seeking accommodations. Founded in 2008, the platform has grown into a global hospitality service that offers a wide variety of lodging options, including apartments, houses, villas, and even unique stays like treehouses and boats. Airbnb operates in more than 220 countries and regions, enabling travelers to experience local cultures by staying in residential neighborhoods rather than traditional hotels.
